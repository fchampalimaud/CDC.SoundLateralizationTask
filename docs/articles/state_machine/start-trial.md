# Start Trial
A trial starts when the rodent pokes his nose in the central nose port (CNP). So this state consists of waiting that the rodent starts poking the CNP. If there is a poke within a certain time limit (for example, 6 seconds), the task continues as it is supposed to, otherwise this trial is aborted.
