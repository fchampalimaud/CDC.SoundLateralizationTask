# Fixation Time
This is the state that precedes the stimulus presentation. The rodent should stay in the CNP during the entire time this state lasts so that the task progresses as expected, otherwise the trial is aborted. The fixation time varies from trial to trial - it is randomly generated - in order to make the timing of the stimulus presentation (which happens as soon as the fixation time ends) unpredictable. If the stimulus presentation timing was predictable, the resultant reaction times would be affected (and biased). The fixation time is given by:

tFix = tBase Fix + (X ∼ Exp(λ))
