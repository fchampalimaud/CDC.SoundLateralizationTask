# Stimulus
This is the state where the stimulus is presented. The stimulus stops when either the rodent leaves the CNP or when the defined presentation time elapses (the presentation time is usually of a few seconds). It is possible to define a minimum reaction time. If the timed reaction time is less than the minimum required, the trial is aborted.
