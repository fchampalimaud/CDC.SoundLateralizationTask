# Reward
The Reward state evaluated wether the rodent got the answer right or not. In case the answer is wrong, a penalty time is applied (10 seconds for instance). If the answer is right, the animal only gets the reward (water) if he stayed in the correct LNP for at least a minimum amount of time.
