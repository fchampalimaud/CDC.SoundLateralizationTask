# Abort
As mentioned before, the Abort state is triggered when some conditions are not met in the previous states. This state consists of a small time penalty (typically about 1 second).

Since this state is one of the two possible final states of a trial, there is a need to set/update some variables that would normally be set/updated in states that the state machine did not get into during the current trial.
