# Choice
In this state, the animal has to pick the side (left or right) which corresponds to the speaker that played the loudest sound by poking in either lateral nose port (LNP).

## Progression conditions
If the animal pokes either LNP after the minimum movement time (MinMT) and before the maximum reaction time (MaxMT), the task proceeds as expected. Otherwise, it is aborted.
