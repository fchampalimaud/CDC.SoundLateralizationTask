# Running the Task

After having everything else setup, the only thing left is to run the task. To do it, follow the steps:
1. In the task's directory, double-click on the `./Run.cmd` script.
2. Answer to the initial prompts. Then, the bonsai workflow will open and start running, as well as the Python application window.
3. In the bonsai workflow, double-click on the `TaskInfo` SubscribeSubject node - it's a green node - to open a window which will be giving feedback about what's happening in the task (_optional_).
