# Running the Task

After having everything else setup, the only thing left is to run the task. To do it, follow the steps:
1. In the task's directory, double-click on the `./Run.cmd` script.
2. Answer the initial prompt. Then, the bonsai workflow will open and the task will start with the GUI that allows the user to monitor the task in real-time and interact with some aspects of it.
